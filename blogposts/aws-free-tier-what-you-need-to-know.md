## Getting Started with AWS Free Tier

### Step 1: Create an AWS Account

To begin, you'll need to create an AWS account. Simply navigate to [AWS Sign Up](https://aws.amazon.com/) and provide the necessary details. Note that a credit card is required, even though you won't be charged for Free Tier eligible usage.

### Step 2: Understand Usage Limits

It's essential to monitor your usage to avoid incurring unexpected charges. AWS provides a [Billing and Cost Management Dashboard](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-and-cost-management-dashboard.html) where you can set up alerts and track your Free Tier usage.

### Step 3: Explore AWS Services

Once your account is set up, start exploring the services. For example, you can launch an EC2 instance by following this [official AWS guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html).

```bash
# AWS CLI command to launch an EC2 instance
aws ec2 run-instances --image-id ami-0abcdef1234567890 --count 1 --instance-type t2.micro --key-name MyKeyPair
```

## Best Practices for Using the AWS Free Tier

- **Set up AWS Budgets**: Use AWS Budgets to create cost and usage budgets that alert you when you exceed your limits.
- **Leverage AWS CloudTrail**: Enable CloudTrail to log API calls and monitor account activity.
- **Regularly Review Resource Usage**: Use the AWS Trusted Advisor to optimize resources and ensure compliance with best practices.
