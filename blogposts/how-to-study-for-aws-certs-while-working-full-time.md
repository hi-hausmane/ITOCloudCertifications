- **Daily Micro-Learning**: Dedicate a few minutes each day to review key concepts or practice questions.

If you have a long commute or regular breaks at work, use that time for quick study sessions. Listening to AWS podcasts or watching video tutorials can be a productive way to learn during downtime.
