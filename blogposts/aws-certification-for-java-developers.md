## Integrating AWS with Java Applications

Java developers can leverage AWS SDK for Java to interact with AWS services programmatically. Here’s a simple example of how to use the AWS SDK to upload an object to an S3 bucket:

```java
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.S3Client;
import software.amazon.awssdk.services.s3.model.PutObjectRequest;
import software.amazon.awssdk.core.sync.RequestBody;

public class S3Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        S3Client s3 = S3Client.builder().build();

        PutObjectRequest request = PutObjectRequest.builder()
                .bucket("my-bucket")
                .key("example.txt")
                .build();

        s3.putObject(request, RequestBody.fromString("Hello, AWS!"));
        System.out.println("File uploaded successfully!");
    }
}
```

This snippet demonstrates how easy it is to integrate AWS into your Java applications, further enhancing your cloud deployment capabilities.
