# From Zero to Cloud Hero: My Journey to AWS Certification

Three months ago, I barely knew what EC2 was. Today, I'm proud to say Iâ€™m **AWS Certified** â€” and working as a cloud engineer at a major tech firm.

## Why I Started

I had a stable dev job, but something was missing â€” I wanted to build scalable systems, design cloud-native applications, and work on cutting-edge infrastructure.

So I made a plan to pass the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate (SAA-C03)](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/). 

## Step-by-Step Breakdown

### Week 1â€“2: Research + Study Plan
I used the [official AWS certification prep page](https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certification-prep/)  to create a structured learning path.

### Week 3â€“6: Deep Dive Learning
I followed these resources:
- AWS Certified Solutions Architect â€“ Associate video course (Udemy)
- Hands-on labs via AWS Free Tier
- Practice exams from Tutorials Dojo

### Week 7â€“8: Mock Exams
I took 5 full-length practice exams and focused on areas where I scored low.

### Week 9: Passed the Exam!

I scored 92% on my first try â€” and felt confident answering every question.

## Lessons Learned

- Start with the [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) 
- Use the [AWS Certified Solutions Architect Study Guide](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/aws-certified-solutions-architect/9781119716202-a9a4c8dc-dba1-4b21-b8bf-ed5c53f3e18e.xhtml) 
- Take notes while studying â€” donâ€™t rely on memory alone
